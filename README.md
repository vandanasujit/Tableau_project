## Project Overview
This project presents a comprehensive sales analysis using Tableau, utilizing the dataset to provide insights into various aspects of business performance. The visualizations created help explore sales trends, profit margins, discount distribution, and regional performance over time.

## Key Visualizations:
#### Quantity & Sales by Year of Order Date and Segment:

#### Ship Mode Analysis:

* Sales and quantity data are broken down by ship mode (Standard, Second Class, etc.), giving insights into how different shipping methods impact sales.
#### Pie Chart: Sum(Sales) by Region:

* A pie chart visualizing the distribution of sales across different regions (West, East, Central, South). This helps compare the relative sales contributions of each region.
#### Sum(Profit) & Sum(Discount) by Sub-Category:

* A bar chart displaying profit and discount values by product sub-categories, offering insights into which categories are driving profitability and where discounts are most commonly applied.
#### Sum(Profit) by State:

* This visualization provides a state-wise breakdown of total profits, helping identify which states are generating the most (or least) profit.
#### Sum(Sales) by State (Map):

* A map view showing total sales by state, making it easy to see geographical sales distribution and hot spots for sales performance.
#### Total Profit & Total Discount by Year of Order Date:

* A trend chart showing how total profit and discounts have evolved year over year, which helps in assessing overall business growth and discount strategies.
#### Sum of Profit by Ship Mode:
